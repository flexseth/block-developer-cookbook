In this template, you will customize the build process provided by @wordpress/scripts and to be able to build a plugin that contains a single custom block , a custom Javascript file that registers a block variation, and a custom CSS file that corresponds to the block variation. We want to keep the code for our block in a blocks directory and the JS/CSS files in a resources directory.

## Usage

`npx @wordpress/create-block example-plugin --template @block-developer-cookbook/customize-build-process`
