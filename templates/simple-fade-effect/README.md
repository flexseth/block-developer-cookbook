In this recipe, you will load custom JavaScript and CSS files for the cover and image blocks to create a simple fade-in effect when the block is scrolled into view. You don't want to load files unless they are needed so you will only enqueue them when the block(s) are on the page.

## Usage

`npx @wordpress/create-block example-plugin --template @block-developer-cookbook/simple-fade-effect`

## Variants

-   `start` - starting files
-   `completed` - final files
